**SIS/TK611/AG09** is the home of the Swedish [ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22](https://www.iso.org/committee/45202.html) mirror.

This page is mostly driven by some members of the Swedish expert group of the local [ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG21](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/) mirror.
But we are open for all *SIS/TK611/AG09* members.
