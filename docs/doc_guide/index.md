# Doc guide

This site uses [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) with the [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and some nice extensions.

Documents are written in Markdown, so they can also be previewed as they are on GitHub.

## Contribution guide

Great effort has been taken to make editing this site as easy as possible.

The basic idea is that **everyone should be enabled to contribute**.

## Changing existing content

If you have write permissions for the github repo, just use the edit link and use GitHub's online editor.
The Markdown editor will give a nice preview of your changes.

If you do not have write permissions for the repo, you are still very welcome to contribute! </br>
Please create your fork and make a pull request.

For a local workflow, that enables to preview changes in a browser, please see the [adding a new page documentation](newpage.md).
